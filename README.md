# 📚 Personal Library Management System

A simple command-line Python application that helps you manage your personal book library. You can add, remove, search, and display books — as well as track which ones you've read.

## 🛠️ Features

- ➕ Add new books
- 🗑️ Remove books by title
- 🔍 Search for books
- 📖 View all books in your library
- 📊 Display statistics (e.g. how many books read)
- ✅ Mark books as read
- ❌ Mark books as unread
- 💾 Data is saved locally using a JSON file (`library.txt`)

---

## 💡 How It Works

Each book entry includes:
- Title
- Author
- Publication Year
- Genre
- Read Status (Yes/No)

The data is saved in a file called `library.txt` in JSON format, so your library persists even after you exit the app.
